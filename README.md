# Cloud-Computing
Cloud computing is a new paradigm for delivering remote computing resources through a network. Cloud Computing moves the application software and data bases to the large data centres, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. The growing crisis in power shortages has brought a concern in existing and future cloud system designs. 

1) Analysis of diffrent threats in cloud computing.
2) To mitigate unnecessary idle power consumption, three power-saving policies with different decision processes and mode-switching controls are considered.
3) The issue of choosing a suitable policy among diverse power managements to reach a relatively high effectiveness has been examined based on the variations of arrival rates and incurred costs.
